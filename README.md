## Goal description

The goal of this project is to develop a Handong University Library Booklet Management and Rental. This system is designed to allow you to register, modify, delete, and inquire information about books and conveniently apply for rentals, returns, reservations, etc. for users. Through this system, Handong University Library can increase the accuracy and reliability of book information and enhance user satisfaction and convenience.

The program can be gradually improved by applying two to three iterations of refactoring. Several functions may be added through this process, and the design of the system may be improved by applying several refactoring methods and different design patterns. As a result, it is expected that through this process, the program will be improved and our goal(good library service) can be achieved.
